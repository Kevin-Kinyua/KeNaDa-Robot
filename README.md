AUTONOMOUS PATH FINDING ROBOT

An initiative of Riara Computer science students, the robot was programmed and designed to perform the following tasks;

    Find a path
    Identify the path
    correct itself on a path
    follow a path
    Stop when the robot encounters and obstacle.

It incorporates various components that facilitate the accomplishments of the above named objectives, namely;
    Arduino Mega 2560 Microproessor
    Sonar proximity sensor (obstacle avoidance)
    5-track infrared sensor (path detection)
    20 x 4 LCD display
    Buzzer
    12V battery
    2 DC motors
    Motor driver
    Chassis(Custom)

The robot has a variety of industrial applications such as the utilisation of Warehouse storage for supply chain stores. 
It can also be designed to accomodate public transportation that would allow a bus, autonomously driven and programmed to make stops at 
specific stages within  its route. The possibilities are endless.
